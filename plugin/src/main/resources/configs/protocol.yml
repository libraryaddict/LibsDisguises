# This config is for options that should only be touched if you're having compatibility issues with other plugins

# Some players have issues with conflicting plugins where disguised entities will show the wrong armor
# This should be left alone unless you're trying to solve this issue. Such as MM and stone blocks.
# When true, the plugin will hide player disguises armor to prevent a minor visual bug for half a second
PlayerHideArmor: true

# Some disguises have randomized options on disguise, such as a fox type or a villager breed.
# This may be problematic for some server owners, so you can disable it below
RandomDisguiseOptions: true

# For self disguises, they need to have the armor and the held item removed
# Else they see floating armor, floating held items.
# This turns the items invisible in the disguised players inventory. It does not actually remove them!
RemoveArmor: true
RemoveHeldItem: false
# An exception for creative mode as this can actually delete the item from the inventory due to creative being weird
RemoveCreativeEquipment: false

# If you set a disguise to burning, it will no longer be able to be shown as sneaking or invisible.
# Set this to true if you want the disguise to get the animations of the disguised entity. Such as invisible, on fire, sprinting, sneaking, blocking
# This is only valid if you set a animation on the disguise itself. Because the entity's animations are applied otherwise.
AddEntityAnimations: true

# This controls if a entity's max health is determined by the entity, or by the disguise.
# Wither is 200, a player is 20. With this enabled, a player disguised as a wither will have the boss bar health accurate to the players health.
# Else it will be 1/20 of the boss bar when they are full health.
# Setting this in LivingWatcher overrides both values.
MaxHealthDeterminedByEntity: true

# This here is a option to turn off misc disguises.
# This means you can not have a living entity disguise as a non-living entity.
# This disables the Attributes packet, Non-living entities can still disguise as other non-living
# This means that the above option will not work as it uses the attribute packet.
MiscDisguisesForLiving: true

# Shall I send the velocity packets? I REALLY recommend you don't disable.
# This is the only thing allowing the mobs to fly without glitching out.
SendVelocity: true

# This will help performance, especially with CPU
# Due to safety reasons, self disguises can never have their packets disabled.
PacketsEnabled:
  # This disables the animation packet. If a disguised entity sends a animation packet and they are using a non-living disguise. People will crash.
  # Disabling this also means that if a player disguised as a non-player leaves a bug. People will crash
  Animation: true
  # This disguises the collect packet. If a living entity disguised as a non-living entity picks up a item. People will crash. This fixes it
  # This also fixes people crashing if a item disguised as a sleeping player is picked up - Only true if Bed is enabled as well
  Collect: true
  # This disables a fix for when a disguised entity wearing armor dies, if the disguise can wear armor. It drops unpickupable items to anyone watching.
  EntityStatus: true
  # Entity equipment is the packets that are sent to ensure that a disguise has or doesn't have armor, and their held item.
  # Disabling this means that any disguises which can wear armor or hold items will show the armor/held item that the disguised is wearing.
  Equipment: true
  # This doesn't actually disable the packet. It would introduce problems. Instead it does the next best thing and caches the data.
  # This means that entity metadata will not change, and will only be sent in the spawn packet.
  # This is good if performance is extremely in need.
  # This is bad to disable unless you are ONLY going to use the disguises for decorations.
  # To be honest. This is basically "Disable entity animations". That option is called 'AddEntityAnimations' in the config but unlike that, this is always in effect.
  # Animations set by use of the api or through the disguise command are still in effect.
  Metadata: true
  # Movement packets are the biggest cpu hit. These are majorly used to ensure that the disguises facing direction isn't bugged up.
  # If you are using the Item_Frame disguise, when a packet is sent (Roughly every 2min) the disguise will bug up until they move.
  Movement: true
  # Disable this if you don't mind crashing everytime you see someone riding something disguised as a non-living entity
  Riding: true
  # When disguised as a wither skull, it sends a look packet every tick so that the wither skull is facing the right way.
  WitherSkull: true
  # This is only used when using a modded disguises thingy, check disguises.yml for more info
  # This is used as a hack to bypass bungeecord issues
  LoginPayload: true

# Added to support a Chinese Minecraft Server which uses their own skin server unless the UUID is not version 4.
# Changing this from 4 to say, 3. Means their server will fetch skins from Mojang instead.
