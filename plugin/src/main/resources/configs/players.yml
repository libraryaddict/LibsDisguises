# This config file is for settings that are about the players themselves, and the player disguises!

# MineSkin will at a later date give you less delay for skin requests, if you fill this in with a valid API you too can take advantage of this!
# This requires you to have a Minecraft account registered with MineSkin, that account must be owned by you and will have its skin changed constantly.
