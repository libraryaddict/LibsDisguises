/**
 * Used to provide multiple methods under the same name for string parsing.
 * Eg, "setType(Boat.Type.OAK)" and "setType(TreeSpecies.GENERIC")
 * Two possible uses, though only one is supported at the moment.
 * The supported one is simply that the method that's working in the current NmsVersion, will handle the parsing.
 * If more than one method claims to support it, we throw an error.
 * <p>
 * The other possible use is to provide fallback parsing where we call "setType GENERIC" and the ParamInfoParser will detect we're
 * talking about an old TreeSpecies and convert it to Boat.Type.OAK
