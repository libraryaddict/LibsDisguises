# This config file is about the names that appear over heads! A fair bit of player disguise stuff is in players.yml however

# This is only called into action when the disguise is constructed using the commands.
# And when the disguise supports that. This will not be used at all for plugins constructing the disguises for instance.
# Such as prophunt. Its also false because its kind of a retarded feature.
# This is pretty simple. It shows the players displayname (Name as it appears in chat) above their head.
# This also overrides any custom name they have set in their disguise options.
# This does not take effect on player disguises
# Permission to disable is libsdisguises.disablename
ShowNamesAboveDisguises: false

# This supports the above option.
# If this is true, then the name shown above the head appears regardless of if you are looking at the disguise directly or not.
NameAboveHeadAlwaysVisible: true

# What should the name be shown as?
# Two placeholders can be used.
# %simple% = The very basic name, 'libraryaddict'
# %complex% = Name will be grabbed from scoreboard or display name if scoreboard fails.
NameAboveDisguise: '%complex%'

# If doing ARMORSTANDS in the above option, should CustomNames for non-player disguises be overridden to use armorstands too?
# This allows multiline names if you have purchased the plugin
# Use \n for a new line, though if you're doing it in a config you may need to use \\n as " and ' are treated differently.
OverrideCustomNames: true

# There are four options you can use
# VANILLA - Names are limited to 16 chars but can't be changed without resending disguise
# TEAMS - Names are limited to 32 chars but can be changed willy nilly
# EXTENDED - Names are limited to 48 chars but can't be changed without resending disguise
# ARMORSTANDS - Names are limited to 256 chars, uses a mix of armorstands and teams to do this. Slightly hacky.
# Downside of armorstand names is that there's a chance of it becoming desynced from the player disguise
# And names will always display even if the entity is invisible using potion effects
# With ArmorStands & the Premium version, you can also use multiple lines in the nametag, use \n as a seperator.
# Read the next option for more information.
PlayerNames: ARMORSTANDS

# More options in case you want to disable a specific setting of the scoreboard
# You can customize self disguises scoreboard in players.yml
Scoreboard:
  # Should it modify the scoreboard to turn collisions off?
  Collisions: true
  # Should it modify the scoreboard teams to disable seeing friendly invisibles?
  DisableFriendlyInvisibles: false
  # Should the scoreboard warn you if it detects a potential conflict?
  # If self disguises are disabled, or the scoreboard is using IGNORE_SCOREBOARD then this does nothing.
  WarnConflict: true
  # When disguising as a player, should the prefix/suffix of the player disguise name copy the team info?
  # Only takes effect if using PlayerNames TEAMS or ARMORSTANDS
  CopyPlayerTeamInfo: true

# Hide players in tab when disguised? This means a disguised player cannot be seen when you press tab! This can be toggled on/off per disguise
HideDisguisedPlayersFromTab: false

# Always show player disguises in tab? The names will continue to appear in tab until the disguise is removed.

# When disguised, should a message be displayed to the player? If so, where?
# The message can be customized in translations
# BOSS_BAR is not supported in 1.12!
# NONE, BOSS_BAR, ACTION_BAR

# If using boss bar, these two options come into play
