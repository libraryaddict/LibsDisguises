# This controls how the plugin attempts to resolve a playername to a Minecraft UUID
# This can be set to one of the following three options, use %s to inject the name into the string
# * https://api.mojang.com/users/profiles/minecraft/%s
# * https://api.minecraftservices.com/minecraft/profile/lookup/name/%s
# * null - So literally 'null', or an empty string. This will attempt to use the built into the server authlib
# You can set this to another url of your choosing, but if you don't know what you're doing...
# NOTE - This is currently defunct, Mojang have broken both endpoints. We're simply going to test both and use whatever works
# We have no way to tell which one will work, no communication on the bug issues.
